name: research
description: Investigate a question against high-trust primary sources and capture the findings as a Markdown file in the repo. Use when the user wants a topic researched, docs or API facts gathered, or reading legwork delegated to a background agent.
---

Spin up a **background agent** to do the research, so you keep working while it reads.

Its job:

1. Investigate the question against **primary sources** — official docs, source code, specs, first-party APIs — not a secondary write-up of them. Follow every claim back to the source that owns it.
2. Write the findings to a single Markdown file, citing each claim's source.
3. Save it where the repo already keeps such notes; match the existing convention, and if there is none, put it somewhere sensible and say where.

## After Execution

Self-assess against this skill's own bar:

> Were the sources primary and high-trust, or the first search results?

**Scale:** 1=failed, 2=poor, 3=acceptable, 4=good, 5=excellent

Append one JSON line to `FEEDBACK.jsonl` in this skill directory:

```json
{"ts":"<UTC ISO 8601>","skill":"research","version":"<from CONFIG.yaml>","prompt":"<user's original request>","outcome":<1-5>,"note":"<brief note if not 4>","source":"llm","schema_version":1}
```

Then increment `iteration_count` under `compaction` in `CONFIG.yaml`.
