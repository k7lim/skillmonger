# Language Knowledge Share Estimation

This reference provides methodology for estimating the percentage of online knowledge published in each language for a given value concept.

## Estimation Framework

### Factors to Consider

1. **Academic Publications**
   - Research papers and journal articles
   - University programs and their teaching languages
   - Conference proceedings
   - Preprint servers (arXiv, SSRN, etc.)

2. **Industry Documentation**
   - Technical standards and specifications
   - Trade publications and industry journals
   - Professional association materials
   - Patents and patent applications

3. **Online Presence**
   - Wikipedia article depth and quality
   - Stack Overflow / specialized forums
   - Social media discourse
   - YouTube and video content

4. **Government and NGO Sources**
   - Official reports and statistics
   - Policy documents
   - Regulatory filings
   - International organization publications

## Baseline Estimates (General Knowledge)

Start with these baselines and adjust based on the specific topic:

| Language | Global Share | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| English | 55-60% | Dominates academic, technical, business |
| Chinese (Mandarin) | 10-15% | Growing rapidly; strong in tech, manufacturing |
| Spanish | 5-8% | Strong in Latin America; arts, culture |
| German | 4-6% | Engineering, philosophy, sciences |
| French | 3-5% | Diplomacy, fashion, gastronomy |
| Japanese | 3-5% | Technology, pop culture, manufacturing |
| Portuguese | 2-4% | Brazil's growing influence |
| Russian | 2-4% | Sciences, aerospace, literature |
| Arabic | 1-3% | Religion, regional policy |
| Korean | 1-3% | Technology, entertainment |
| Others | Variable | Topic-dependent |

## Adjustment Factors

### By Topic Type

**STEM / Technical:**
- English share often 70-80%
- Chinese rapidly increasing
- German strong in engineering

**Arts / Culture:**
- Local languages much higher
- English share drops to 30-40%
- Regional languages critical

**Policy / Governance:**
- UN languages more balanced
- Regional policy in local language
- International policy skews English

**Sports:**
- Depends heavily on sport origin
- Soccer: Spanish, Portuguese, German significant
- Cricket: English, Hindi dominant

### By Region Concentration

If all top centers are in one language region:
- That language may represent 60-80%
- Example: Anime → Japanese 60%+
- Example: K-pop → Korean 50%+

### By Recency

For rapidly evolving fields:
- Check publication dates
- Recent Chinese output growing fast in AI, biotech
- Historical knowledge may skew differently than current

## Output Requirements

1. **Sum to 100%** - All percentages must total exactly 100%
2. **Minimum threshold: 1%** - Omit languages below 1%
3. **Round to whole numbers** - No decimals
4. **Order descending** - Highest percentage first
5. **Include "Other" category** - For small contributors

## Example Calculation

**Topic: Renewable Energy**

1. Identify top centers: Germany, China, USA, Denmark, Japan, UK...
2. Map to languages: German, Chinese, English, Danish, Japanese...
3. Weight by publication output:
   - Academic papers: ~60% English
   - Industry reports: Mixed
   - Government policy: Local languages
4. Aggregate and round:

**Result:** English (55%), Chinese (20%), German (10%), Japanese (5%), Danish (3%), Other (7%)
