I don't know this area of code well. Go up a layer of abstraction. Give me a map of all the relevant modules and callers, using the project's domain glossary vocabulary.

## After Execution

Self-assess: Did the response give a higher-level map using the project's domain language without getting stuck in implementation detail?

Map: 5=clear map with relevant modules/callers, 4=useful context with minor gaps, 3=some orientation, 2=too low-level or generic, 1=misleading map.

Append one JSON line to `FEEDBACK.jsonl` in this skill directory — the copy you
are running from, not the skillmonger repo:

```json
{"ts":"<UTC ISO 8601>","skill":"zoom-out","version":"<skill.version from CONFIG.yaml>","prompt":"<the user's original request>","outcome":<1-5>,"note":"<one line, especially when the outcome is not 4>","source":"llm","session":"<this session's id>","schema_version":1}
```

Drop `session` if you do not know this session's id. That line is the whole
record: nothing in `CONFIG.yaml` is edited by a run.

Use `"source":"user"` when the score came from the user rather than from your
own assessment.
