1. **See the current state** of the merge/rebase. Check git history, and the conflicting files.

2. **Find the primary sources** for each conflict. Understand deeply why each change was made, and what the original intent was. Read the commit messages, check the PRs, check original issues/tickets.

3. **Resolve each hunk.** Preserve both intents where possible. Where incompatible, pick the one matching the merge's stated goal and note the trade-off. Do **not** invent new behaviour. Always resolve; never `--abort`.

4. Discover the project's **automated checks** and run them — typically typecheck, then tests, then format. Fix anything the merge broke.

5. **Finish the merge/rebase.** Stage everything and commit. If rebasing, continue the rebase process until all commits are rebased.

## After Execution

Self-assess against this skill's own bar:

> Did the resolution preserve both sides' intent, or just pick one?

**Scale:** 1=failed, 2=poor, 3=acceptable, 4=good, 5=excellent

Append one JSON line to `FEEDBACK.jsonl` in this skill directory:

```json
{"ts":"<UTC ISO 8601>","skill":"resolving-merge-conflicts","version":"<from CONFIG.yaml>","prompt":"<user's original request>","outcome":<1-5>,"note":"<brief note if not 4>","source":"llm","schema_version":1}
```

Then increment `iteration_count` under `compaction` in `CONFIG.yaml`.
