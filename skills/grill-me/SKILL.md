description: Interview the user relentlessly about a plan or design until reaching shared understanding, resolving each branch of the decision tree. Use when user wants to stress-test a plan, get grilled on their design, or mentions "grill me".

Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer.

Ask the questions one at a time.

If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead.

## After Execution

Self-assess: Did the grilling uncover the key decision branches, resolve dependencies one at a time, and give a recommended answer for each question?

Map: 5=shared understanding reached, 4=major branches covered, 3=some useful questions but incomplete, 2=scattered interview, 1=failed to stress-test the plan.

Append one JSON line to `FEEDBACK.jsonl` in this skill directory — the copy you
are running from, not the skillmonger repo:

```json
{"ts":"<UTC ISO 8601>","skill":"grill-me","version":"<skill.version from CONFIG.yaml>","prompt":"<the user's original request>","outcome":<1-5>,"note":"<one line, especially when the outcome is not 4>","source":"llm","session":"<this session's id>","schema_version":1}
```

Drop `session` if you do not know this session's id. That line is the whole
record: nothing in `CONFIG.yaml` is edited by a run.

Use `"source":"user"` when the score came from the user rather than from your
own assessment.
